This directory is where final Metashape project files (.psx) would be stored.

In a real project, this directory would contain completed Metashape project files for each transect:
- 2023_FAST_T1_final.psx
- 2023_FAST_T2_final.psx
- 2023_SLOW_T3_final.psx

These files represent the completed 3D reconstruction process including dense cloud generation, mesh creation, and texture mapping.
