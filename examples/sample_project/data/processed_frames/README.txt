This directory is where edited/processed frames would be stored after color correction and other adjustments.

In a real project, this directory would contain subdirectories for each transect:
- 2023_FAST_T1/
- 2023_FAST_T2/
- 2023_SLOW_T3/

Each subdirectory would contain edited image files that have been processed in Adobe Lightroom or Bridge using the standard TCRMP color correction presets.
