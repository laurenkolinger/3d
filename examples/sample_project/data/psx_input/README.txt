This directory is where Metashape initial project files (.psx) would be stored.

In a real project, this directory would contain Metashape project files for each transect:
- 2023_FAST_T1.psx
- 2023_FAST_T2.psx
- 2023_SLOW_T3.psx

These files are created in the initial stages of 3D model creation and are used for importing photos, camera alignment, and sparse cloud generation.
