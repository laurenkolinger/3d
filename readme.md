# 3D Processing Pipeline

A comprehensive workflow for processing 3D models from video footage.

## Overview

This project provides a set of Python scripts to automate the workflow of processing underwater video footage into 3D models of coral reefs. The pipeline uses Agisoft Metashape for 3D reconstruction and is designed to work with the Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP) methodology.

## Requirements

- Agisoft Metashape Pro (v2.1.1 or later)
- Python 3.9 (for both local environment and Metashape compatibility)
- FFmpeg (for video frame extraction in Step 0)
- Required Python packages (specific versions in `requirements.txt`):
  - PyYAML
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - opencv-python
  - matplotlib
  - pillow
- **Note:** This pipeline has been developed and tested primarily on macOS. Compatibility and performance on Windows or Linux are not guaranteed.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Repository Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurenkolinger/3d.git
cd 3d
```

### 2. Create Project Directory Structure

Create all necessary directories for your project:
```bash
# From the workspace root, create the required directories
mkdir -p {PROJECT_DIR}/{video_source,processing,output}
```

This will create the following directory structure:
```
{PROJECT_DIR}/
├── video_source/                    # Input video files
├── processing/                      # Intermediate processing data
│   ├── frames/                      # Extracted frames organized by model (Step 0)
│   └── psxraw/                      # Initial PSX files (Step 1)
└── output/                          # All final outputs
    ├── psx/                         # Consolidated PSX files by site (Step 2)
    ├── orthomosaics/                # Orthomosaic outputs (Step 3)
    │   └── {MODEL_ID}/              # Each model in its own subdirectory
    │       └── {MODEL_ID}.tif       # Clean model ID filename
    ├── models/                      # 3D model outputs (Step 3)
    │   └── {MODEL_ID}/              # Each model in its own subdirectory
    │       ├── {MODEL_ID}.obj       # Clean model ID filename
    │       └── [texture files]      # Associated texture files
    ├── reports/                     # Processing reports (Step 3)
    │   ├── {MODEL_ID}.pdf           # Clean model ID filename (flat structure)
    │   └── {MODEL_ID}.pdf           # All reports in same directory
    ├── logs/                        # Processing logs
    └── final/                       # Final high-resolution outputs (Step 4)
```

**Important:** Once this directory structure is created, do not rename or move the standard subdirectories (`video_source`, `processing`, `output`). The scripts rely on this specific structure. The only manual change expected within `{PROJECT_DIR}` after setup is adding your video files to the `{PROJECT_DIR}/video_source/` directory.

Copy and configure the analysis parameters file:
```bash
# Copy the base configuration file to your project
cp analysis_params.yaml {PROJECT_DIR}/
```

The configuration file (`analysis_params.yaml`) located within your `{PROJECT_DIR}` contains all the settings for the project.

Make sure to:

1. Review and update the description and notes inside the `{PROJECT_DIR}/analysis_params.yaml` file.
2. Adjust any processing parameters within the `{PROJECT_DIR}/analysis_params.yaml` file as needed for your specific project.
3. Note that the primary input/output directory paths (`video_source`, `processing`, `output`, etc.) are derived automatically by the scripts based on the `{PROJECT_DIR}` you provide when running them. 

## Standardized File Naming

The pipeline uses a clean, standardized naming system for all outputs:

- **Model ID Format:** All file names use the exact Model ID (e.g., `TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2`)
- **No Suffixes:** Files are named simply as `{MODEL_ID}.ext`
- **Organized Structure:** 
  - Orthomosaics and models get their own subdirectories: `output/orthomosaics/{MODEL_ID}/` and `output/models/{MODEL_ID}/`
  - Reports are flat in `output/reports/{MODEL_ID}.pdf`
- **Consistent Across Scripts:** Both `step3.py` and `step3_manualScale.py` produce identical file names and structure

**Example Output:**
```
output/
├── orthomosaics/
│   └── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2/
│       └── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2.tif
├── models/
│   └── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2/
│       ├── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2.obj
│       └── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2.jpg  # texture file
└── reports/
    └── TCRMP20241014_3D_BWR_T2.pdf
```

### 3. Installing Dependencies

The pipeline requires dependencies in two Python environments:

1. Your local environment (for frame extraction - step0.py)
2. Metashape's Python environment (for 3D processing - step1.py and beyond)

#### Local Environment Setup

Create a Python virtual environment in your project:
```bash
# Create virtual environment in project directory using Python 3.9
python3.9 -m venv {PROJECT_DIR}/.venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source {PROJECT_DIR}/.venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running Metashape Scripts

To run Metashape scripts with the correct Python environment, you'll need to set the PYTHONPATH to point to your virtual environment's site-packages. This ensures Metashape uses the packages from your virtual environment while maintaining compatibility with Metashape's Python 3.9.

The general format for running Metashape scripts is:
```bash
PYTHONPATH={PROJECT_DIR}/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages /Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/stepX.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

Where `stepX.py` is the specific step you want to run (step1.py, step2.py, etc.) and `{PROJECT_DIR}` is the path to your project directory containing `analysis_params.yaml`.

## Workflow Overview

The complete processing workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Frame Extraction** (step0.py): Extract frames from video footage
2. **Initial 3D Processing** (step1.py): Process extracted frames to create initial 3D models
3. **Manual Quality Check & Alignment**: Check and align models (manual step)
4. **Chunk Management** (step2.py): Organize chunks by site
5. **Manual Straightening & Scaling**: Straighten and scale models (manual step)
6. **Model Processing and Exports** (step3.py): Add scale bars, remove small components, export assets
7. **Manual Touchups**: Review and touch up models (manual step)
8. **Final Exports & Web Publishing** (step4.py): Create final exports and upload to Sketchfab

**Note:** Each script will prompt for the project directory containing the `analysis_params.yaml` file if not provided as a command-line argument. This allows processing different projects without code modifications, as source files will be linked to individual project directories dynamically for each run.

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 0: Frame Extraction

Extracts frames from video footage at a specified rate.

```bash
python src/step0.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

Scans `video_source/` for videos, extracts frames to `processing/frames/`, and creates tracking CSV files.

### Step 1: Initial 3D Processing ⏱️ *Most Time-Consuming*

Performs initial 3D reconstruction using extracted frames. Creates batched PSX files with multiple models grouped for efficiency.

```bash
PYTHONPATH={PROJECT_DIR}/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages /Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step1.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

Groups models into batches, aligns cameras, builds depth maps, creates 3D models with textures, and saves to `processing/psxraw/`.

### Manual Step: Quality Check & Alignment

After Step 1, manually check the quality of generated models:

1. Open each PSX file in `processing/psxraw/` with Metashape
2. For each model (chunk): review camera alignment, check point cloud quality, verify model IDs are correctly labeled
3. Save the project

### Step 2: Chunk Management

Consolidates chunks by site to prepare for final processing.

```bash
PYTHONPATH={PROJECT_DIR}/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages /Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step2.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

Groups models by site and creates new PSX files organized by site in `output/psx/`.

### Manual Step: Straightening & Scaling Preparation

After Step 2, manually straighten each model and prepare for scaling:

1. Open each project in the `output/psx/` directory
2. For each chunk in the project:

   **Straightening (always required):**
   - Load the textured model
   - Auto-adjust brightness and contrast in one of the images to improve texture
   - Switch to rotate model view
   - Rotate the model so it aligns horizontally at the top of the view
   - Use "Model > Region > Rotate Region to View" to set the alignment
   - Resize the region to "crop" to the model area (use top XY and side views)
   - Use the rectangular crop tool to crop to the model area bounded by the region

   **Scaling Preparation:**
   - **For automatic scaling (Step 3a):** Ensure coded targets are visible and properly positioned
   - **For manual scaling (Step 3b):** Place markers on scale bars, set up at least 2 scale bars at different locations, set known distances in Reference pane, verify error < 0.01
   
3. Save the project and quit Metashape

### Step 3: Model Processing and Exports

This step processes models with scaling, removes small components, and exports orthomosaics, textured models, and reports using standardized file naming.

**Approach 1: Try Automatic Scaling First (Recommended, if coded targets present)**

```bash
# Run automatic scaling first (detects coded targets)
/Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step3.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

**If automatic scaling fails or no coded targets are present:**

**Approach 2: Reset and Use Manual Scaling**

```bash
# Reset to preserve Step 0&1 work, clear Step 2+ outputs
python src/utility/reset_step1.py {PROJECT_DIR}

# Re-run Step 2 (this is pretty quick)
PYTHONPATH={PROJECT_DIR}/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages /Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step2.py {PROJECT_DIR}

# Manually straighten and add scale bars in Metashape GUI (see Manual Step above)
# Then run manual scale processing:
/Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step3_manualScale.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

**Alternative: Start with Manual Scaling**
If you know there are no coded targets or prefer manual scaling from the start, skip `step3.py` and go directly to the manual workflow above.

**Both approaches produce identical outputs:**
- Orthomosaics: `output/orthomosaics/{MODEL_ID}/{MODEL_ID}.tif`
- Models: `output/models/{MODEL_ID}/{MODEL_ID}.obj` 
- Reports: `output/reports/{MODEL_ID}.pdf`

### Manual Step: Model Review and Touchups

After Step 3, manually review and touch up the models:

1. Open each project in Metashape
2. For each chunk: review orthomosaic and textured model quality, fill small holes if needed, adjust texture blending, verify scale bars and small component removal
3. Save the project

### Step 4: Final Exports and Web Publishing

Creates final high-resolution outputs and uploads decimated models to Sketchfab for web viewing.

```bash
/Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/step4.py {PROJECT_DIR}
```

Creates decimated models for web, uploads to Sketchfab (if configured), exports high-resolution assets to `output/final/`.

## Configuration

Edit `{PROJECT_DIR}/analysis_params.yaml` for project-specific settings. Scripts automatically load configurations from this file, enabling processing of different projects without code modifications.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **max_chunks_per_psx**: Maximum number of chunks/models per PSX file (default: 5)
- **reconstruction_uncertainty**: Maximum allowable reconstruction uncertainty (default: 50)
- **reprojection_error**: Maximum reprojection error in pixels (default: 1)
- **projection_accuracy**: Maximum projection accuracy value (default: 10)
- **depth_downscale**: Downscale factor for depth maps (default: 4)
- **texture_size**: Texture size in pixels (default: 16384)

See the configuration files for complete parameter descriptions.

## Utility Scripts

These scripts provide helpful utilities for managing the processing environment.

### `src/utility/reset_full.py`

**Complete Project Reset** - Resets project to **BEFORE Step 0** (frame extraction).

**What it does:**
- 🗑️ Empties `processing/` and `output/` directories completely
- 📁 **Keeps** empty folder structure (`processing/`, `output/` directories remain)
- 🗑️ Removes all tracking CSV files
- 🔒 **Preserves:** `video_source/`, `analysis_params.yaml`, `.venv/`

**Usage:**
```bash
python src/utility/reset_full.py /path/to/project
```

**When to use:** Starting completely over from the beginning (frame extraction).

### `src/utility/reset_step1.py`

**Reset After Step 1** - Preserves Steps 0 & 1, clears Steps 2+ outputs.

**What it PRESERVES (the time-consuming work):**
- 🔒 Step 0: Extracted frames (`processing/frames/`)
- 🔒 Step 1: PSX files (`processing/psxraw/`)  
- 🔒 Step 0 & Step 1 tracking status

**What it CLEARS:**
- 🗑️ Step 2+: All `output/` directory contents (consolidated PSX, orthomosaics, models, reports)
- 🗑️ Step 2+ tracking status (resets to "Step 1 complete")

**Usage:**
```bash
python src/utility/reset_step1.py /path/to/project
```

**When to use:** Re-running Step 2 (chunk management) and subsequent steps while preserving hours of Step 0 & Step 1 processing time.

### `src/utility/enumerate_gpus.py`

This Python script lists the available GPUs that Metashape can detect and use. This is useful for verifying GPU configuration and ensuring Metashape is utilizing the expected hardware acceleration.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run using Metashape's Python environment
/Applications/MetashapePro.app/Contents/MacOS/MetashapePro -r src/utility/enumerate_gpus.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Package Import Errors in Metashape**
   
   If you encounter import errors for packages like numpy, pandas, or PyYAML when running scripts through Metashape, you'll need to install these packages in Metashape's Python environment. Use the provided installation scripts:
   
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   ./src/legacy/install_metashape_deps.sh
   ```

2. **PSX files not generated**
   
   Ensure that the `psxraw` directory exists and is writable. Check the log file in the `reports` directory for error messages.

3. **"Module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'"**
   
   This error typically occurs with incompatible numpy versions. Use our installation scripts to install the compatible version in Metashape's Python environment.

4. **Metashape Python version mismatch**
   
   If your Metashape version uses a different Python version than 3.9, you may need to modify the installation scripts to point to the correct Python interpreter.
